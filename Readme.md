## What is? | ![ Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sudo-give-me-coffee/PhotoGIMP.svg?branch=master)

PhotoGIMP is originally a GIMP layout modification to look like Adobe Photoshop made by Dionathan Simione from Diolinux. A lot of people only uses GIMP with the modification. This patch on GIMP helps who want to use the original theme by embedding it on GIMP.
